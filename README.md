# Getting Started Guide
 
## Using this guide
This guide provides instructors with an overview of important concepts related to the CbK curriculum org and the repositories within it. This guide should be the starting point for instrucotrs who are looking for guidance on how to use the curriculum org, what curriculum resources are in it and how to use them. This guide is not meant to provide instructors wih detailed curriculum information or procedure guidance.

## Navigating the curriculum org
Repositories in the curriculum guide are divided into 4 categories: 
  1. Guides - Guide repos start with the word "guide" and provide instructors with basic information and guidance about a specific topic or aspect of the curriculum resources. What the guide relates to will be in the repo name.
  2. Lessons - Repos that start with "lesson" are the project guides that instructors should use in class with students. Instructors should have students fork the lesson repo for the project they are working on before starting the project. Students will then work from the forked repo. Each lesson repo will have the levels covered in the repo name.
  3. Assessments - Assessments
  4. Deprecated Resources - Deprecated resources

## Using the lesson repos
Each lesson repo will contain an INSTRUCTORGUIDE.md and PROJECTGUIDE.md files. Each PROJECTGUIDE.md file has a status badge.  

### INSTRUCTORGUIDE.md
The INSTRUCTORGUIDE.md file contains basic information about that specific project guide and provides instructors with instructions on how to use the guide.

### PROJECTGUIDE.md
The PROJECTGUIDE.md file is where instructors work with students to add their project details and where instructors track student progress as they move through the project.

### Badges
Each PROJECTGUIDE.md file has a status badge near the top of the file.

![state: not ready/building](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not%20ready%2fbuilding-yellow.svg) - The not ready/building badge is used for repos that are currently being built out and our not ready for general use in the classroom.

![state: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-orange.svg) - The experimental badge is used for repos that are complete, but are being used to test concepts. The concepts in experimental repos may not ever make it into general classroom use. These repos should not be used as regular projects for students during the normal class process. These repos should only be used to test the specific experimental concepts in the project guide.

![state: ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ready-green.svg) - The ready badge is used for repos that are complete and ready to be used with students in the normal class process.

![state: brainstorming](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-brainstorming-lightgrey.svg) - The brainstorming badge is used for repos that can be started by any instructor and may at some point be structured into an experimental repo. Brainstorming repos are for instructors to dump ideas they may have to add to, improve upon, remove from, or create new projects.

![state: deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg) - The deprecated badge is used for repos that should no longer be used, but are kept in the curriculum organization for reference and historical purposes.
